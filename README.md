# Projects
## HandJam
Python · Swift · Numpy · Scikit-Learn · CoreML · iOS

[Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0zJtxdkSoU) An iOS app made for helping people learn sign language. It was made in collaboration with Sasha Ivanov, Adnan Karim, Daniel Artuso, Igor Pieter, and myself. Adnan Karim and I designed a machine learning algorithm to detect hand signs in real time. 

## Jupiter 
C++ · Yacc · Bison · WebAssembly

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/JupiterCompiler) A from-scratch compiler for a subset of the Java language. The frontend is implemented with Yacc and Bison and the backed is simple C. It complies to WebAssembly and implements a small standard library.

## Neural Stocks
Python · Numpy · Matplotlib 

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/Neural-Stocks) A neural network that utilizes various adjacent data sources in order to give predictions to prices of specific stocks. This project was featured in the [Canada Wide Science Fair](https://secure.youthscience.ca/virtualcwsf/projectdetails.php?id=4665&year=2016&province=6&keyword=&name=&categoryid=&divisionid=&challengeid=&regionid=) and also won an award from the [Statistical Society of Canada](https://ssc.ca/en/news/senior-high-school-student-wins-ssc-award)

## Coriander
Python · Flask · Todoist

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/Coriander) A recipe management and meal planning app. It integrates with the Todoist API in order to make grocery lists automatically.

## Daily Page
JavaScript · Vue · Vuetify · Electron

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/DailyPage) An app for daily journalling. 

## Vance
Haskell

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/Vance) A Lambda Calculus interpreter written in Haskell. This interpreter can do all alpha and beta reductions.

## SubType
Haskell

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/SubType) A type checker and infer-er made in Haskell. It implements simple types such as Natural numbers, as well as complex types like pairs and lists.

## How Did They Win
Python · Numpy · Matplotlib

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/HowDidTheyWin) A collection of scripts to generate animated point differential graphs for NBA games.

## BreakOut
C · MC68K

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/Breakout) An implementation of the original brick breaking game written for the Atari ST. It is written without system calls and interfaces with all hardware and I/O directly. High performance portions are written in MC68K assembly, lower performing parts are written in C.

## Game of Life
C · MC68K

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/Game-Of-Life) A [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation written in C and MC68K assembly for the Atari ST. It runs in real time with the core algorithm and screen drawing written in assembly.

## Mandelbrot
C++ · ImageMagick

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/Recursive-Mandelbrot) A Mandelbrot set image generator written in C++ with the ImageMagick library. It is implemented via a recursive Zeta function. 

## Computer Automated Drummer
Python

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/Computer-Automated-Drummer) A program that generates MIDI drum loops based on some user input and basic music theory. 

## Specter
Python · OpenCV · Matplotlib · Scikit-Learn · OpenCV

[Link.](https://github.com/imcauley/Specter) A Python program that implements eye tracking using OpenCV and a simple machine learning model.
